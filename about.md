I'm Evelio Tarazona Cáceres, Systems and Computing Engineer with postgraduate studies on Databases. I’ve been building mobile apps for over seven years on five different platforms, I’m currently a Senior Software Engineer at [Lyft](https://lyft.com/).

I’m really into Android, naturally I’ve built multiple Android apps and libraries from scratch that have been used by millions of users and garnered high ratings. My first Android device was a Nexus One, running on brand new Eclair. I often contribute to open source projects and have participated as speaker on Free Software and Android sessions.

I take my crafting seriously and like to think that what I do is an expression and part of myself, I always go the extra mile for quality and style.
